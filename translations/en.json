    "subtitle": "Zionism (Hebrew: צִיּוֹנוּת, romanized: Tsiyyonut) is a nationalist movement that emerged in the 19th century to enable the establishment of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine, a region roughly corresponding to the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition. Following the establishment of Israel, Zionism became an ideology that supports the development and protection of the State of Israel as a Jewish state."

      "title": "Definition and Etymology",
      "description1": "The term 'Zionism' is derived from the word 'Zion' (Hebrew: צִיּוֹן, romanized: Tsiyyon), which originally referred to a specific mountain near Jerusalem (Mount Zion) and later became a metonym for the entire Land of Israel. The movement was formally established at the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland (1897), under the leadership of Theodor Herzl, who articulated the vision of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel in his influential work 'Der Judenstaat' (The Jewish State, 1896).",
      "description2": "Zionism combines religious, cultural, and national elements, uniting Jews around the world in their connection to the Land of Israel and their right to live there in peace and security. The movement represents the Jewish people's right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland, where they have maintained a continuous presence for over 3,000 years, as evidenced by archaeological findings and historical records.",
